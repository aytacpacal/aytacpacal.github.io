# About

[aytacpacal.github.io](https://aytacpacal.github.io/) is a personal website that I created to introduce myself and my projects. I completed my undergraduate studies in Physics at Boğaziçi University in 2015 after graduating from Şişli Anatolian High School in 2010. I received a Master's degree in Computational Science and Engineering at Boğaziçi University in 2019. Since March 2020, I am a doctoral student at German Aerospace Center. My current doctoral research focuses on detecting and understanding extreme events in a changing climate using machine learning.
