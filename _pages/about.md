I completed my undergraduate studies in Physics at [Boğaziçi University](https://www.boun.edu.tr/en-US/Index) in 2015 after graduating from Şişli Anatolian High School in 2010. I received an M.Sc. degree in Computational Science and Engineering from Boğaziçi University in 2019. I completed my doctoral studies at the [University of Bremen](https://www.uni-bremen.de/) in 2025. I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at the [DLR Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (German Aerospace Centre)](https://www.dlr.de/).

I believe that scientific knowledge should be simplified in order to convey it to people effectively. Otherwise, scientific facts alone will not be sufficient to safeguard the future of the Earth. With this idea in mind, I created a YouTube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/mevzubilim) to publish videos and interviews on commonly misunderstood scientific topics.

During my master studies, I focused on visualizing climate change data in Turkey and the MENA region and analysed the return periods of extreme weather events. In my doctoral research, I explored how machine learning can help detect and understand extreme events and heatwaves in a changing climate. My research interests include climate change, extreme weather events, machine learning applications in climate science, and data visualization.
