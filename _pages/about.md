I completed my undergraduate studies in Physics at [Boğaziçi University](https://www.boun.edu.tr/en-US/Index) in 2015 after graduating from Şişli Anatolian High School in 2010. I received an M.Sc. degree in Computational Science and Engineering from Boğaziçi University in 2019. Since March 2020, I have been a doctoral student at the [German Aerospace Centre](https://www.dlr.de/).

I believe that scientific knowledge should be simplified in order to convey it to people effectively. Otherwise, scientific facts alone will not be sufficient to safeguard the future of the Earth. With this idea in mind, I created a YouTube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/mevzubilim) to produce and publish videos on commonly misunderstood scientific topics.

During my master's studies, I worked on visualizing climate change data in Turkey and the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region, and analysed the return periods of extreme weather events. My current [doctoral research](publications) focuses on detecting and understanding extreme events in a changing climate using machine learning.
